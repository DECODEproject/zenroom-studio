# Zenroom Studio

Zenroom Studio is a multiplatform (Gnu+Linux, Windows, macOS) IDE designed specifically to work with [Zenroom](https://github.com/DECODEproject/zenroom)

The main use case for Zenroom is that of **distributed computing** of untrusted code where advanced cryptographic functions are required, for instance it can be used as a distributed ledger implementation (also known as **blockchain smart contracts**).

Zenroom and Zenroom Studio are software in **ALPHA stage** and are part of the [DECODE project](https://decodeproject.eu) about data-ownership and [technological sovereignty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvBRbwBm_nQ). Our effort is that of improving people's awareness of how their data is processed by algorithms, as well facilitate the work of developers to create along [privacy by design principles](https://decodeproject.eu/publications/privacy-design-strategies-decode-architecture) using algorithms that can be deployed in any situation without any change.
