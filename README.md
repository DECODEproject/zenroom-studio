# Zenroom Studio

Zenroom Studio is a multiplatform (Gnu+Linux, Windows, macOS) IDE designed specifically to work with [Zenroom](https://github.com/DECODEproject/zenroom)

The main use case for Zenroom is that of **distributed computing** of untrusted code where advanced cryptographic functions are required, for instance it can be used as a distributed ledger implementation (also known as **blockchain smart contracts**).

Zenroom and Zenroom Studio are software in **ALPHA stage** and are part of the [DECODE project](https://decodeproject.eu) about data-ownership and [technological sovereignty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvBRbwBm_nQ). Our effort is that of improving people's awareness of how their data is processed by algorithms, as well facilitate the work of developers to create along [privacy by design principles](https://decodeproject.eu/publications/privacy-design-strategies-decode-architecture) using algorithms that can be deployed in any situation without any change.

## :memo: Notes

### Packaging
To build the packages for your platform there are some commands available listed below. Please note that in order to build the *windows executable* you need [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) installed and configured, and for build the *mac .dmg package* you need to run the command on a macOS operating system.

#### :apple: macOS

`yarn package-mac`


#### :penguin: Gnu+Linux

`yarn package-linux`

#### :checkered_flag: Windows

`yarn package-win`

#### To build all platforms

`yarn package-all`


### Linting
All the code is configured to be linted with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). So especially for new code contributions is preferrable to run and fix the lint suggestions.

#### Javascript
* Run the linter
`yarn lint`

* Automagically fix lint suggestions
`yarn lint-fix`

#### CSS
* Run the linter
`yarn lint-styles`

* Automagically fix lint suggestions
`yarn lint-styles-fix`


***
## :bug: Troubleshooting & debugging

### Debug mode
To run Zenroom Studio in debug mode you'll need first to install it on your local machine following the instructions listed in [Installation#Development](#development)
and after run

`yarn run dev`

This will enable the inspector in electron/chrome and gives you more verbose output on the console.

### Common problems
* `error eslint@5.1.0: The engine "node" is incompatible with this module. Expected version "^6.14.0 || ^8.10.0 || >=9.10.0".` 
You need to upgrade you node version to a newer version. Take a look [here](https://davidwalsh.name/upgrade-nodejs).
